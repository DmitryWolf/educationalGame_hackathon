# Educational game for elementary school students
The project was written in the 10th grade in a team with a friend [Sergey](https://github.com/SergeyDanielyan)

The rules are simple: the playing field is like a monopoly. There are questions on the cells: points are awarded for correct answers to questions, and points are deducted for incorrect ones. The winner is the one who scores N points

In fact, you can change the pool of questions, so the game can be adjusted to any group of people
